# VR-Neuroscience-Research
Attempted to explore the neural response of the Motor Cortex and the Parietal Lobe in horror experiences in VR vs Monitors. 

I used OpenViBE, a neuroscience software for interacting with Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) and analyzing the received data with different spacial and frequency filters.
