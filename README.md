# VR-Neuroscience-Research

Virtual Reality is the newest addition in the entertainment industry. It provides a level of
immersion never achieved before, by immersing the userâ€™s visual sense in the simulation through
gyroscopic and spatial measurement tools contained within the device. To measure the
effectiveness of this extra immersion, horror simulations on both a computer screen and the Gear
VR was used as a stimulus and Mu and Beta waves strengths were measured through a 32
channel EEG headset measuring data at 256 Hz in the frontal lobe, motor cortex, and the
occipital lobe. Horror simulations were specifically used because fear will produce a stronger
signal for the EEG headset to read compared to emotions such as compassion or anger. Fear is
also an easier signal to stimulate compared to other emotions. The Virtual reality headset is
expected to create a significantly stronger Beta wave and a significantly weaker Mu rhythm than
the signals from the screen simulation because Beta wave activity is associated with increased
activity and Mu rhythms are associated with a calm mind. OpenViBE was used to collect the
data and run a Spectral Analysis on the data. Despite difficulty with setting up the virtual reality
system, the Gear VR used with the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, strong data was collected with the
Virtual Reality horror simulation, Sisters, resulting in eight times stronger beta waves signal
strength at the time of a jump scare. Sadly, the Mu rhythm data and all of the screen simulation
data was either corrupted or not collected using the right method resulting in a lack of data to
complete the study. In the future, more time should be partitioned for data collection and more
participants should be used, so that the data is more varied and stable.
